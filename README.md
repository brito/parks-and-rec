# Getting Started

1. Download Oracle Enterprise Tools for Eclipse (OEPE).
2. The latest version is likely to be ahead of this source, so do a migration once you import this project.
3. This mini-app is built with one task flow and one backing bean (Location.java)

## Files you want to look at:

1. maf-application
2. maf-features
3. \*.amx
4. Location.java
5. skin.css

## Super useful scripts:

1. build.xml as an entry point to generating iOS and Android resources
2. resources.js
3. ninepatch.js
