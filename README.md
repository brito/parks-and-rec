# Getting Started

1. [Download OEPE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/eclipse/downloads/index.html)
2. The latest version is likely to be ahead of this source, so do a migration once you import this project.
3. This mini-app is built with one task flow and one backing bean (Location.java)

## Learn all about MAF

1. [OEPE Documentation](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/eclipse/documentation/index.html)

## About

This repository is provided as-is and is a bare-bones demonstration of a couple of MAF abilities. There are many more examples that come with OEPE and tutorials available to help you integrate with MCS and other backends, for example.
